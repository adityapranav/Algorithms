Insertion Sort 

Input: a1,a2......,an  =>  A sequence of n numbers 
Output:  a permutation of the sequence such that (a1',a2'......., an') , a1' <= a2'.....<= an'

An efficient algorithm for sorting small number of elements

Works in same way as playing cards. 

start with empty hand. Remove each card from pile and insert into the right position in left hand.

for choosing the right position, compare the picked card with all the cards in hand from right to left.


for i:=2 to n {
   int key = a[i];
   rightposition = getRightPosition(i-1, a, key);
   a[rightposition] = key;
}

getRightPosition(int x, int[] a, int key) {
   for i:=x to 1 {
     if (a[i] > key) {
	    a[i+1] = a[i];
	 }else {
	    return i+1;
	 }
   }
   return i+1;
}
